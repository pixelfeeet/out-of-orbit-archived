###Description
<p>Out of Orbit (working title) is a 2D exploration-heavy survival game, currently under development by me.  The player guides an unnamed cosmonaut who has crash-landed on an strange, foreign planet, and must help him surivive, regain his skills, and eventually fix his ship and return home.</p>
<p>Here are some of the features the full game will include:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Procedurally generated maps!</li>
	<li>RPG style leveling system!</li>
	<li>A shop/crafting system!</li>
	<li>Pixel art made by me!</li>
	<li>Sound design also by me!</li>
</ul>
<p>The game is still in early stages of development, and should be ready for it's first Alpha release in early 2013. In the meantime, you can look at its <a href="https://github.com/chrisdfe/out-of-orbit">git repository</a>.</p>
